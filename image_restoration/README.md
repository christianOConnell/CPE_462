# Image Restoration Project

MATLAB Code for:
1. Inverse Filtering
2. Iterative Processing
3. Mean Square Error (MSE)

Three codes that each can take in your image, blur it, add noise to it, and then make it less blurry and noisy.  
In collaboration with https://github.com/jshepitka/ and https://github.com/andrewshamis/
